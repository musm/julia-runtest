# julia-runtest Action

This action runs the tests in a Julia package.

## Usage

And example workflow that uses this action might look like this:

```
name: Run tests

  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        julia-version: ['1', '1.0']
        julia-arch: [x64, x86]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]
        exclude:
          - os: macOS-latest
            julia-arch: x86
